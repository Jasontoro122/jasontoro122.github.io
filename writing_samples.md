## Writing Sample 1  
*The following is a story written in 30 minutes as part of Creative Writing Club. The concept is a creature who was created on a spaceship and is engaging with its environment, unsure of it's own strength.*  
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is so scared of me.  
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing - I believe it is male - looks at me from across the room. I have never seen a creature so simultaneously frightened and angry as this one was. It did not know how to react to my presence. It wore the flesh of plants, wrapped around its body for protection, as if it was a hunter adorning itself with its prey. I am unimpressed.  
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look down at my own prey. A female, I believe, the 12th of this type that I have outmatched. The male shouts in anger as I reach down towards the female. I had opened a hole in its stomach while it was checking around the corner to see me. I was worried it would spoil the surprise.   
	Another shout, and I feel a cold stone hit me in the leg. It hurt a little bit, but not enough to distract me. I picked up the female and slung it under my arm. I look back up at the man, who slung another cold stone at me. I do not know how he slung stones at me; it was currently clutching some sort of small device. It looked as though someone had stitched together two boxes, and then added a third, much smaller box.   
It shouts again, and there is a flash from the box. The stone spins towards me, and I step out of the way. The male looks quite surprised, and his eyes are slow to track where I have moved to. It lowers its device in fear.  
I figure it wants the female, and I am not one to interrupt mating ceremonies, so I throw it. I misjudged how durable these creatures are, however, and as the female releases from my grip, there is a sickening crunching noise. It smashes against the wall, and crumples to the floor. The male screams in agony, as if the body limp on the ground was his own.  
It picks up the device and three more flashes appear. I use the flashes to make my hasty retreat down the hallway, the pitter-patter of the spaceship interior all too familiar.   
I turn right, and see there, around the corner, a small opening. Above the opening reads some words in the language these beings speak, and an image of a smiling woman. It’s lips are crimson red, as if it had recently indulged in a morsel. I figure a spot of hunting would not be out of the question, and so head inside to investigate.  
Unfortunately, it seems that whatever morsels the woman indulged in were now extinct, and the inside of the area completely without life. All that remained in this area were much more fancy versions of the plant armor that the male was wearing, typically without the things they call Pockets, and much too low to allow ease of movement. I cautiously move along; any human being able to tear through flesh with its teeth might prove to be a dangerous opponent, especially if it were able to hunt while armored with such inefficient gear.  
In due time, I finally see one of my own. I approach it, and it approaches me with the same speed. It is very grey, almost the same color as the spaceship interior. I had not noted before, but our species is of a very similar shape to the humans I had encountered before, but a little taller, and our fingers look awfully long compared to their slender appendages.  
I attempt to signal my brethren, who signal back immediately, almost as soon as I do. In fact, it is an awfully potent mimic of every motion I go through, and I commend it on its mimicry with a shrill whine. It appears to attempt to do the same in time with me, but I am unable to hear it. I decide to move along.  
I had not heard what my creator had wanted to do on this spacecraft. He simply told me I was on a spacecraft, and then he was lunch. I cannot be blamed; he was awfully tasty.  
So instead I roam, looking for something else I may partake in, as I felt my essense shiver in anticipation of my next meal. And it is not long, luckily, before I see it.  
It is the male from before, still clutching his device. It seemed to have moistened itself, or at least its face, since the last time I had seen it. I did not wish to interrupt its business, so I follow closely behind, staying quite out of sight. I would have been seen multiple times, but unlike human beings, I was not cursed with the ability to make shadow.  
A few times during our walk, he turned to see something behind him. I would have hated to get in the way of what he saw, so I sprinted to stay on the side of his back. I made a little bit of a commotion, which seemed to ebb away at the sanity of the male, but it was better that he saw where he was going, in case he planned on walking anywhere.  
At last, it seemed that the male’s adventure was reaching an end, which was easy to tell, as the man began to pick up the pace towards an opening, titled something. Inside this opening were small orbs, one of which it frantically enters a passcode into, causing the orb itself to open, and he quickly climbs inside. I follow him inside, as I want a friend.  
The male enters a passcode and sits down, breathing a sigh of relief as the orb detaches itself from the spaceship and flies towards earth.  
I look at his forehead as he slowly begins to look up, and mutter my first word.  
“Friend.”  

## Writing Sample 2  
*The following is an excerpt from an essay about Transmedial Worlds about Street Fighter II and Street Fighter: The Movie. Research was done from essays about the Pirate ride which later inspired Disney's Pirates of the Carribean*  
...The first issue that plagued Street Fighter (Movie) was the problem of reinvisioning. In an essay by Celia Pearce and Bobby Schweizer, “Remediation on the High Seas,” the pair discuss the transition between “the Pirates mythos” of the Disney Pirates ride – a mythos of disconnected references – into a “unifying narrative” (p. 100, 2016). Unlike this transition, however, there would be no “charismatic ne’re-do-well Jack Sparrow” (Pearce & Schweizer, p. 100, 2016) to save Street Fighter (Movie), as the plot was instead centered around Colonel Guile’s plan to stop the evil General M. Bison from conquering the world with supersoldiers (Universal Studios, 1994). This was a change in the “mythos” and “ethos” of the world of Street Fighter II, which is a tournament world focusing on fighting to figure out who is the strongest warrior (Kastrup & Tosca, p. 4, 2004) and instead replaces every single character motivation with either the promise of money, or revenge. This was seen as a downgrade by the audience, as the tone of the film became that of a G. I. Joe experience, rather than one attributed to a series about intense martial arts and proving thyself, with one of the biggest offenders being the change of Ryu and Ken to American con artists (Universal Studios, 1994).  
	In addition, four of Wolf’s aspects of transmediality fell flat with the production of Street Fighter (Movie). “Description” failed in the way that the world was created – Shadaloo, the South Asian nation that M. Bison operates from, was unspecific and vague; the abilities of the characters would not have stood on their own without the knowledge of the video game; the science of the world is strange; and character backstory is often just shouted at the audience, rather than being shown (p. 250-252, 2012). In a game, the level of unspecificity worked, because the narrative was not clear or unimportant; however, the movie’s description was, at best, weakened by its lack of clear, crisp description.  
	Visually, the movie adaptation was imperfect. Costume design was close enough to the game world to be easily recognizable – Guile’s interesting haircut, for example, was kept – while enough changes were made to make the wartime setting more reasonable. This is more true for some characters than others, with some fan favorites looking completely different; Dhalsim, for example, looks nothing like the more culturally significant look he has in his games, instead being reduced to an Indian doctor stereotype (Universal Studios, 1994). This narrative separation between the games and movie was significant enough to be a disappointment amongst most fans, requiring knowledge of the game and characters to call each other by name before the adaptation made any level of sense. In this case, the “normalizing tendency” (Wolf, p. 255, 2012) that the producer felt when adapting Street Fighter II negatively affected the appearance of the film, and its credibility as a Street Fighter feature.  
	Audibally, the movie suffered greatly from poor acting and lack of knowledge about the games. Very little connected the attacks that the characters did to the memorable abilities used by the Street Fighter II cast. This lack of connection “frustrated expectations” (Wolf, p. 259, 2012) of players who watched the movie and wanted to see Street Fighter II on the big screen, because there were hardly any connection to the game other than the characters’ names and some of their backstories (Universal Studios, 1994).  
	The deinteractivation (Wolf, p. 263, 2012) of the game to movie form was it’s downfall. There was too much of a new world, too little connective tissue, and too few references to the game for most players to connect with the movie called Street Fighter. While most transmedial worlds are able to stand by its own, “independent of the original form” (Wolf, p. 247, 2012), Street Fighter was not an interesting enough story to stand by its own, and so separated from the original content that it could never really be considered a major player in Street Fighter’s legacy. And so, it faded into obscurity, and the games continued to be iterated on and improved, forgetting the movie, or the game based on the movie, ever existed...  
 
 ## Writing Sample 3  
 *The following is an excerpt of a novel that I am currently working on. The main character, Derrel, is stuck in a massive prison just outside of a port town of Marelado. He comes back to his cell to see he has a roommate*
 At the end of the day, his hands smelling like the sea, the terrified eyes of hundreds of fish staining his mind, he sees a hunched figure in the corner of his cell. His mind dances with excitement.  
	*Oh, grand! A roommate. It’s been, what, three years since Gerald got taken away? Oh, man! This is day is going uph-*  
	Then he saw her face, bruised and swollen from a guard’s boot, her leg bent in a horrific angle, the fire blazing in her eyes. His pranks would have to wait as his panic starts to set in.  
	His eyes flicker back and forth, and he pulls out his fishing knife he stole a few months ago, after being mugged for all of his drachma. He sweeps the feathers off a few planks. The knife isn’t sharp after a few months of work, but it does the job. He spits to the side, out of the cell to the prison yard. The woman stares at the back of his head. A plank falls to the floor.  
	“Hey, listen,” he mutters, “It’d help me a lot if your eyes weren’t on my neck.”  
	She stays silent and keeps staring.  
	Another plank collapses to the ground, attached to the first. He pulls the wooden nails out of the two planks and tears off a part of his shirt. He looks at her leg and winces as his gaze moves to her eyes. “Alright, just… Just, uh…”  
	Her gaze looked at his movements. She had some sort of cloth that wraps around her head, hiding most of her coal-black hair. Though her cheek is swollen, Derrel notes her high cheekbones and sturdy facial structure. And she notes his panic.  
	“You have no idea what you’re doing, do you?” Her voice was high-pitched and posh – elegant, even, despite the swollen cheek forcing a lisp.   
	*She must be from the Mainland. Derrel winces.* “No.” Mainlanders are rare on Marelado, mostly just trade partners or foreign dignitaries. Derrel never met one of them up close, but her accent was familiar to him from a few ventures to the Marelado marketplace.  
	She closes her eyes and groans. “Alright, well, at least you’ve got the tools… One plank on each side, wrap the cloth around them both. As many strips as you can manage.”   
	Derrel stares at the tattered cloth of his shirt and groans. “As… Many? Two’s not enough?”   
“No.”  
He closes his eyes and takes his shirt off, revealing a torturously small frame. He quickly starts tearing strips of cloth from their origin, trying to recall some of the knots he made in his carpentry shop. He gives her one cloth to bite on, and then sets to work.  
	She stays conscious the whole time, despite his mistakes, even guiding his hand to the planks to keep them close as she finishes up a knot. *She’s a tough one, alright… I wonder how the guards even broke her leg. She must have put up one hell of a fight.*  
	The splint finished, she spits out the cloth and groans, rubbing her cheek. Derrel hops onto his bed, but notices that the guards didn’t leave her any feathers. He sighs and brushes some of the feathers off of what remains of his bed, leaving them in a pile on the ground away from his area of rest. The whole time, her eyes burn into his head.  
	“I… I didn’t say thanks back there.” Her elegant tilt rings in his ear.  “You may be an idiot, but that was pretty nice of you.”  
	Derrel raises a brow and chuckles, “Calling me an idiot with a broken leg, are you? You have a few lessons to learn, missy.”  
	“What are you going to do, mug me? Step on my leg? I dare you.”  
	The fire in her eyes makes Derrel hesitate.  
She smiles, a smug gesture of domination. “I thought so. Now, where am I?”  
	Derrel blinks, “You don’t even know where you are?”  
	“No, of course I don’t know where I am. If you haven’t noticed, I don’t exactly look like you or anyone around here.”  
	Derrel rubs his neck and climbs off his bed. “Well... welcome to Marelado Prison. It’s not the most comfy p-”  
	“No, no, I can’t be on godsdamned Marelado of all places!” Her eyes lose the fire for a mere second, and she holds her head in her hands.  
	Derrel’s brows both raise. “Wow, hey, c’mon, it isn’t that bad! What’d they catch you for? Theft, murder?”  
	“I didn’t do anything! At all! I’ve never even been to this place!”  
	*None of us did, lady.* Derrel grunts and spits to the side. “Sure, and I’m the king of the Mai-”  
	The woman screams and backs away from the wall, seemingly immune to the pain of the splint in her panicked state. Derrel raises a brow and looks to see what she’s looking at. It’s his spit.  
	And it’s a dark, crimson red.
