We’re looking at a sort of *age of bots* right now. Nothing sentient, nothing Skynet-level, but they’re all around. As noted in the Motherboard article, [*How to Think About Bots*](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkzpdm/how-to-think-about-bots), Woolley notes all sorts of potential uses of bots; "Bots measure [the technical health of the internet](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/techtank/posts/2015/06/8-future-of-iot-part-1), share [information on natural disasters](https://twitter.com/earthquakesLA?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), predict [disease outbreaks](http://time.com/3086550/ebola-outbreak-africa-world-health-organization/)," etc. etc.  
The list goes on and on. Bots are capable of doing a lot of stuff, and all of it helpful for humans. Well… Sort of.  
There are problem bots noted in this article, such as the [Random Darknet Shopper](https://wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.bitnik.org/r/), that cause major amounts of grief for author and police alike. Of course, we can never forget movies such as the *Terminator* and *The Matrix*, where sentient AI causes the end of the world, and humanity as we know it.  
We are required to think about regulation, now. Even today, there’s multiple [bans on robot brothels](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2018/10/09/307368/harris-county-moves-to-ban-robot-brothels/) going on throughout the south, problems with ethics inherit to creating “anthropomorphic devices”.  
How far can we get with this before it starts becoming a real problem? Some would argue that the algorithms made for Amazon might be pushing the envelope of “too far,” while some are begging for fully-automated robots with [potentially, emotions and thoughts, as well as senses of humor.](https://nerdist.com/sophia-robot-first-citizen-saudi-arabia/)  
I, for one, welcome this idea of robots becoming more and more sentient. I don’t believe we, as humans, should allow bots to build other bots, for safety’s sake (as I do fear Skynet). But, I have faith that we can use this sentient AI to find out more about how we, as humans, connect ideas and thoughts together. And hopefully, those regulations will also stop robo-brothels.
