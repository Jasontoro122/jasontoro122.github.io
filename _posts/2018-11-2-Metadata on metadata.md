This week is an odd one. We look into the idea of visualizing data through *Dear Data* and [Visualizing Hamilton](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/hamilton/) in some of the most stunning pieces of metadata I’ve ever had the honor of viewing. Seriously. It puts my ideas of what I plan on doing for Dear (My) Data to shame.  
I want to talk about the *Dear Data* a bit. There’s a trend in Giorgia and Stephanie, where Giorgia focuses on topic connections, such as family members, while Stephanie has a focus on dates, specifically Monday through Sunday. It’s funny, because it shows how much our culture changes data. Giorgia is from Italy, which tends to be more connected between one another, while Stephanie is from America, where we need to be busy all the time, and watching our schedule. This is not to say Stephanie’s representations of data are worse than Giorgia’s; far from it, they are even slightly easier for myself to understand. I wish I had the dedication these women have, so I could see such amazing pieces of information.  
Don’t even get me STARTED on [Visualizing Hamilton!](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/hamilton/) What an insane usage of the media to do what Giorgia and Stephanie did so well on postcard. This piece is to *Dear Data* as [17776](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football) is to novels; the latter is a fantastic usage of images to tell stories, but the former utilizes the power of the internet in order to maximize interactivity and the potential that the media offers.  
Hopefully, this becomes somewhat of a trend in metadata. I feel as if more people would pay attention in that case. That’s not to say that people do, because [plenty of people do have creative pieces of metadata](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/transforming-raw-scientific-data-into-sculpture-and-song-235223/), but if this became a trend in science, maybe more people would pay attention to these massive problems that affect our society.
