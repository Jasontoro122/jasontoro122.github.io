  My mother has a cabinet *filled* with books. Loaded with them. Covers of cookbooks, nursing articles, science, art, famous novels, genres that I don't even know about. I asked her once when I was little how many of those she read, and she answered me plainly;
> None of them.

###### Art in Literature

  Something that comes up a tiny, teensy bit in Sci-Fi literature is how cool things look like. In the book [Binti](https://www.amazon.com/Binti-Nnedi-Okorafor-ebook/dp/B00Y7RWXHU), the main character of Binti has this device on her that all people have, the Astrolabe. The Astrolabe serves as an identification device that records its holder's history. As a Master Harmonizer, Binti's father makes "some of the finest astrolabes" that people know of (Page 18). The Astrolabe is much, much more complex and distinct than a book, but the design on the outside of the astrolabe doesn't matter. And yet, people would "probably kill each other to buy" astrolabes made at her father's shops, simply because they look so beautiful (Page 17).  
  That's far from the only occassion in Sci-Fi where something as simple as how a device looks might influence the rate at which it is purchased. There was a speculative short story, known as ["The End of Books"](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/u/uzanne/octave/end/), where the author, Octave Uzanne, imagined a world where books were replaced by cylinders, in which the author can put their voice within them and the "readers" of the future will simply listen to them. Then the conversation came to bindings; with these cylinders, how could people flaunt the quality of their intellect? Uzanne had a quick and easy answer; the cylinders would have "morocco cases, adorned with fine gildings and symbolic figures, as in former days." According to this author, fanciful bindings would transcend beyond even the complete replacement of books.
  "Don't judge a book by its cover" is a completely fair statement; the quality of a book should be within its contents, not the fancy makeup put on afterwards. But, as [multiple](http://www.scottishbooktrust.com/blog/reading/2015/05/death-of-the-book-cover-do-covers-really-matter) [articles](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-gale/do-book-covers-matter-do-_b_5080696.html) [note](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/aug/03/jacketsrequiredwhycoverart), book covers are completely essential to the purchasing experience. The Kindle slogs in inferiority simply because you can't see the *entire* library at once; a Bookshelf shows that infinite majesty in a much bigger, better scale. So, once our audio cylinders hit the shelves, and our lives are recorded on small spheres in our pockets, make sure yours has a pretty picture on it, because we're gonna judge that by its cover.
